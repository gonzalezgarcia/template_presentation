## Overview

::: {.fragment}

### Outline

- Definitions (FAIR/Reproducibility)
- Introduction to tools (Quarto and GitHub)
- If there is time: Demo?

:::

::: {.fragment}

### Learning objectives ^[thanks to Digital Research Academy didactics lesson by Julia Pauquet :pray:] 

- You can share your teaching materials in accordance with FAIR principles
- You can develop reproducible teaching materials collaboratively using tools like Quarto and Git(Hub)

:::

## What is FAIR? 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}

**Findable**

- Descriptive metadata and persistent identifier

**Accessible**

- Data could be openly available OR authentication and authorisation procedures are necessary

**Interoperable**

- Data needs to be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows

**Reusable**

- Documentation and license

# How does FAIR apply to teaching materials? 

Teaching materials can be considered as similar/equal to research outputs.
FAIR principles also apply! 

## FAIR teaching materials? 
::: columns
::: {.column width="42%"}
::: {.fragment}

#### Findable/Accessible

- Share your slides/materials on a data repository to receive a DOI and ensure long term preservation
  - [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (indexed, DOI, preservation)
  - [OSF](https://osf.io/) (DOI?, forkable)
- Share your materials via a journal article 
  - [Taking the TU Delft Carpentries Workshops Online](https://doi.org/10.7191/jeslib.2022.1221 (2022))
- Share your materials in a training material registry
  - [TesS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) (ELIXIR)
  - [OERcommons](https://oercommons.org/)

:::
:::

::: {.column width="58%"}
::: {.fragment}

#### Interoperable

- Use commonly used formats (powerpoint) or open formats such as markdown documents 
  - Pdf is open but difficult to reuse!
- Use common terminology
  - Instructor/Helpers for Carpentry workshops
- Integrate with other resources where possible 
  - Citations
  - Reuse of slides

:::

::: {.fragment}

#### Reusable

- Add documentation
  - Information sheets
- Add metadata
  - learning objectives!, required resources, structure
- Share under an Open License such as CC-BY
  - For slides/data: [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) 
  - For software/code: [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/)

## Ten simple rules for making training materials FAIR

# "Reproducible and FAIR Teaching Materials"

## What is Reproducibility?

*"\[...\] when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset
\[...\] produce the same answer."* ([Turing
Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions))

![[by Scriberia for The Turing Way community (CC-BY
4.0)](https://zenodo.org/record/3678226/files/ReproducibleDefinitionGrid.jpg?download=1)](https://zenodo.org/record/3678226/files/ReproducibleDefinitionGrid.jpg?download=1){width="50%"
fig-align="center"}

## How does reproducbility apply to teaching materials? 

Comes close to the Interoperability and Reusable principles: 

- Integrating materials
- Formatting
- Software/code
- Similar learning goals/objectives and outcomes

::: fragment

**Practice what you preach!**

By setting up your teaching materials in a reproducible manner, you demonstrate the value of reproducibility directly

:::

## FAIR and reproducible training materials are beneficial to you! 

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}

- Information sheets saves time in sharing information
- Clear communication (or you can update the information!)
- Saves time in on-boarding/re-using materials
- Preserved & Findable
- Easy to share within and outside your team
- Provides you and collaborators with credit (visibility, DOI, citations)

## What is version control?

::: {.fragment}
*"Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a [...] set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later [...]"* ([Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html))
:::

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
{{< fa laptop-code >}} keep track of changes in a directory (a "repository")

{{< fa code-commit >}} take snapshots ("commits") of your repo at any time

{{< fa timeline >}} know the history: what was changed when by whom

{{< fa code-compare >}} compare commits and go back to any previous state

{{< fa code-pull-request >}} work on parallel "branches" & flexibly "merge" them

{{< fa brands github >}} {{< fa brands gitlab >}} share repos on platforms like GitHub or GitLab

{{< fa people-group >}} work together on the same files at the same time

{{< fa pen-to-square >}} others can read, copy, edit and suggest changes

{{< fa box-open >}} make your repo public and openly share your work

```{=html}
<iframe width="100%" height="74%" src="https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/dra-fair-teaching" title="DRA FAIR Teaching repository"></iframe>
```

::: {.notes}
- Practice what you preach
- Leading by example
:::

## More benefits of Git(Hub) for (teaching) project management

::: {.incremental}
- {{< fa bug >}} Discuss and plan your teaching preparation in [issues](https://github.com/features/issues) (even just with your future / past self)
- {{< fa comments >}}  Ask questions, share ideas and discuss with your community via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions)
- {{< fa code-pull-request >}} Propose changes to the teaching materials using [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) ^[*pull* requests on GitHub, *merge* requests on GitLab]
- {{< fa code-fork >}} Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of someone else's repository and extend their teaching materials
- {{< fa key >}} Manage access to your teaching materials with detailed [permissions and roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)
- {{< fa book-medical >}} Add documentation to your repository or in a separate [wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)
- {{< fa graduation-cap >}} Access to more features and tools for teaching via [GitHub Campus Global](https://education.github.com/)
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Note**

- {{< fa brands github >}} The dominance of GitHub (a for-profit company owned by Microsoft) is not uncontested (see [#GiveUpGitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/))
- {{< fa boxes-packing >}} A project on GitHub is not a FAIR archiving of scholarly outputs (see previous and following slides)
:::

::: {.notes}
- GitHub Copilot is a for-profit AI product trained with projects that were hosted on GitHub, including many that have licenses that require proper author attribution etc.
- GitHub has a for-profit software services contract with the USA Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
- Archiving on GitHub is not enough
:::

## Example: Collaborative workflow with issues and pull requests

```

# Example: Research Data Management 101 Course at TU Delft Library (TNW RDM 101)

## Course Manual (Example of a [Quarto Book](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/))

**Summary:** This course provides PhD candidates with the essential knowledge and the core skills to manage research data according to best practice.

```

# Example: Course on "Version Control of Code & Data" at the University of Hamburg

## Course Website (Example of a [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/))

**Summary:** A hands-on seminar about version control of code and data using Git with curated online materials, interactive discussions, quizzes and exercises, targeted at (aspiring) researchers in Psychology & Neuroscience.

<iframe width="100%" height="74%" src="https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-course-uhh-ws23/" title="Course Website"></iframe>
```

::: {.notes}
- Course website is the main entry point for students before, during and after the course
- Contents: Overview, course details, schedule, information about the team, additional resources and course mechaniscs
- Practical advantage: Update course information independently from university websites that are out of your control

#### Integrate your teaching materials on GitHub with Zenodo

> "*To **make your repositories easier to reference in academic literature**, you can create persistent identifiers, also known as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).
You can use the data archiving tool [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) to archive a repository on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and issue a DOI for the archive.*"
